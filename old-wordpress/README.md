balancedteam.org was originally a WordPress site — so just in case:

* balancedteam.WordPress.2024-08-02.xml — an export of the original balancedteam.org WordPress site
* Two conversions of this site made with [wp2hugo](https://github.com/ashishb/wp2hugo) that were the basis of the new Hugo based site:
    - generated-2024-08-02-17-30-02.tgz
    - generated-2025-03-13-10-38-11.tgz
* A download of the raw site using wget
    - balancedteam.org-2025-03-26.tgz (main site)
    - 149708021.v2.pressablecdn.com-2025-03-26.tgz (images from CDN)
