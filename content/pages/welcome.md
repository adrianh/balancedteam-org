Balanced Team is a global movement of people who value multi-disciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery focused on customer value as a source for innovation. We're a self-organizing group that learns from each other as we explore processes and methodologies to do good work with happy teams. We welcome people who wear many hats (design, development, testing, product management, marketing and sales, to name a few).

If you’re interested in Lean Startup, Agile, Lean, Agile UX, Lean UX, Devops, Customer Development – and anything else that values multi-disciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery of value – We hope you will join the conversation!

### Our values:

- Create trust
- Share experiments
- Celebrate failure
- Welcome diverse voices

## Event Calendar

We hold larger events (like the [Balanced Team Summit 2015](/btgr2015/)) once a year or so. We have local communities in the United States and Europe.
