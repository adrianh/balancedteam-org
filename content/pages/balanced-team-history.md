# What is Balanced Team?

Balanced Team is a group of people who are interested in furthering processes and methodologies to create great things. We welcome people who wear many hats (design, development, testing, product management, marketing and sales) and we value multi-disciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery focused on customer value as a source for innovation.

We are a self-organizing, international organization with virtual and face-to-face touchpoints:

- [www.balancedteam.org](www.balancedteam.org "Balanced Team Blog")
- [groups.google.com/group/balancedteam](groups.google.com/group/balancedteam "Balanced Team Google Group")
- In-person retreats and social events

# Balanced Team Origins

Balanced Team grew from the contributions of many people over time. Here is a brief review of some key events and activities that led us to where we are now.

**August 2009 “Agile Evolution”** [![Beyond Agile August 2009](/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2009.08_BeyondAgile.team_1-300x225.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2009.08_BeyondAgile.team_1.jpg) [Jeff Patton](Jeff Patton "Jeff Patton LinkedIn") and [David Hussman](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-hussman/0/44a/21 "David Hussman LinkedIn") organized an “Agile Evolution” meeting before Agile 2009 in Chicago. Jeff invited a number of Agile and UX thought-leaders, including Alan Cooper, Desiree Sy, Jared Spool and Lane Goldstone, who later become active participants in Balanced Team.

**Genesis of the first Agile UX retreat**

Jeff Patton introduced [Lane Goldstone](http://www.lanegoldstone.com "Lane Halley's website") to [Anders Ramsay](http://www.andersramsay.com/ "Anders Ramsay's website"). They started to hang out together and spend a lot of time talking about how to blend agile and UX. Lane and Anders wanted to see the two communities communicate better, and include other disciplines as well. They decided the best way to advance this mission was to bring together like-minded people in a retreat format and see what happened. Lane reached out to Alan Cooper to host the first event and we were off and running!

# Event History

## January 2010 “Agile UX Retreat” in San Francisco CA

The first Agile UX retreat was a two day event at [Cooper](http://www.cooper.com "Cooper's website"). Highlights included:

[![Agile UX Retreat January 2010](/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2010.01_AUXR.SF_.team_-300x199.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2010.01_AUXR.SF_.team_.jpg)

- Confidentiality agreements made it possible to discuss things openly
- Event self-organized as it evolved
- Lots of open conversation between agile developers and designers
- Key insight: No more "Us and Them" thinking
- A strong feeling we were onto something and desire to continue meeting and talking

Between the major events, group members held smaller events in London and Florida to share what we were learning and recruit new members.

## July 2010 “Agile UX Retreat” in Grand Rapids, MI

After the first San Francisco event at Cooper, people realized that adding a third day at the start of the event to get to know each other would be beneficial. The next Agile UX Retreat started with a reception at [Atomic Object](http://www.atomicobject.com "Atomic Object website") and continued at [The Factory](http://http://workthefactory.com/ "The Factory website") for two days of workshops. Highlights included:

- Continued work of first event
- Realized that onboarding new people was important and challenging
- worked on “Humanifesto,” and Problem statement(s)
- Brainstormed new names, “Balance” was chosen
- Commitment to continue holding events

Shortly after this event, we created our blog, [www.balancedteam.org](https://balancedteam.org) with a masthead designed by [Paul Hart](http://www.linkedin.com/in/pauljhart "Paul Hart's LinkedIn").

## December 2010 “Agile UX Retreat” in New York, NY

 [Pivotal NYC](http://http://pivotallabs.com/ "Pivotal Labs website") hosted our next three-day event. By this point, we had a number of participants who had attended several events and we started to gel as a working group. After our round of lightning talks to catch up with what we were all learning/doing, we worked on next steps. Some people wanted to put on a public event that was educational in nature (100+ people, invited speakers), the other wanted to continue the smaller, invitational events to share practices (<50 people, participatory). In the end, our inability to find a good venue we could afford pushed us towards the smaller format for the next event in SF. Highlights included:

[![Agile UX Retreat December 2010](/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2010.12_AUXr.NY_.team_1-300x225.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2010.12_AUXr.NY_.team_1.jpg)

- “Lean UX” concept brought to group by Janice Fraser, [LUXr](http://www.LUXr.co)
- Lightning talks showed how people were starting to bring balanced team practices to their work
- Decision to hold next event in SF

## June 2015 Balanced Team Summit in Grand Rapids, MI

 [![BTGR2015-group-labeled](/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BTGR2015-group-labeled.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BTGR2015-group-labeled.png)

The Balanced Team Summit was a three-day event in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Our theme was  "Balanced Teams Everywhere."

Balance is action guided by incremental adjustments, rather than an achieved state. At the 2015 Balanced Team Summit, we explored and shared the latest techniques and innovations of Balanced Teams in different sized organizations in the software industry and beyond. Throughout it all, we considered the question, "What does it mean to be a balanced team?"

Highlights included:

- Opening and social mixers at Atomic Object
- Day One: Invited speakers
- Day Two: Community contributions
- Closing party at the Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts
