title: Balanced Team Sunday Salon NYC April 13

We're very excited to announce that the next Balanced Team event in NY will be a Sunday Salon on 4/13 at Pivotal Labs in Chelsea. On the heels of [The LeanUX Conference](http://leanuxnyc.co/nyc/), Balanced Team will hold a one-day synthesizing symposium to share ideas, socialize, and continue the conversation.

The plan: gather everyone for brunch (Bagels! Mimosas!). Generate topics of interest. Split into small groups based on topic. Discuss in groups, and create a poster. Present a summary of the poster. Go home, chill out, enjoy what's left of the weekend. (Or maybe head to the bar w/ your Balanced Team friends!) Plus a helping of the Balanced Team fixtures (Welcoming new community members! Fishbowls! Closing circle!) that're starting to become community rituals.

We're announcing the salon to the BT community first. In a few days, we'll announce to the LeanUX conference Tickets are $10, and available via [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/balanced-team-nyc-2014-tickets-10709790271). Scholarships are available if the cost is a hardship; just email me off-list. Event details will be managed through [Lanyrd.](http://lanyrd.com/2014/balanced-team-nyc/)
