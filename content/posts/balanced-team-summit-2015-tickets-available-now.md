We're excitedÂ to announce that tickets are now available for the [upcoming summit in Grand Rapids in June](/btgr2015/). Early bird ticket sales will run through February 15; standard ticket sales will begin after that. There are a limited number of early bird tickets available, so buy now and save some cash while you can! We'd greatly appreciate your early support.

[Visit the event website](/btgr2015/) for more information on ticket sales, and of course the event itself.

Your planning committee: Matt Fletcher, Lane Halley, Rick Harlow, Brittany Hunter and Gail Swanson.

PS

Our call for proposals runs through February 6. We're pleased with what's come in so far, but we would love to hear some more ideas for great talks! Visit [our CFP page](http://goo.gl/forms/bupHkuJxQ5) for more information.
