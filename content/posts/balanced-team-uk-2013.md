**Bored with missing the fun US Balanced Team events? Want a one or two day UK Balanced Team conference?**

**[Then you should fill in this 3 question survey now.](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RQ2MTHR)**

Don't know what Balanced Team is about? Go read the [history of Balanced Team](/balanced-team-history/) and check out the [Balanced Team 2011](/balconf-2011-resources/) and [Balanced Team 2012](/2012/07/17/balanced-team-2012-video/) conferences.

Basically - if you're into Lean Startup, Agile, Lean, Agile UX, Lean UX, Devops, Customer Development - and anything else that values multi-disciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery focused on customer value - you'll probably find this of interest.

Discussion on further details will happen on the Balanced Team mailing list. [You should join the mailing list too.](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/balancedteam)

Thanks - and hope to see you at Balanced Team UK 2013.
