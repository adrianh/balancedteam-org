_Update 3/11/2015: A [Balanced Team / LeanUX NYC Social](/2015/03/04/btny-leanux-2015/ "Balanced Team / LeanUX NYC Social") has been scheduled for April 15. The NYC Salon will be pushed back to a later date._
Please save the date for a Balanced Team Salon on Sunday April 19, 2015 in New York City! It will be hosted by [CompStak](http://www.compstak.com/gateway/about) at [36 Cooper Square](https://www.google.com/maps/place/36+Cooper+Sq,+New+York,+NY+10003) in Manhattan. The planning committee includes Jonathan Berger, Ray Delapena of Catalyst, and Jeff Domke and Rick Winslow of CompStak.

The session will run for a half-day starting late AM or afternoon, depending on the Lean UX NYC conference schedule and visiting attendees’ plans.

The event will include brunch/snacks, beverages, socializing, small group break-out sessions and a recap, similar to prior BT Salons. Topics are entirely open for consideration, and we’ll solicit ideas soon.

Looking forward to making new friends visiting for the week, and seeing NYC BT’ers, too! More info to come...
