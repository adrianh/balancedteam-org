title: Resources for Broken Comb People
url: /2012/07/05/resources-for-broken-comb-people/

---
At the recent Balanced Team conference in Chicago, a popular theme was "broken comb people." In response to the idea of the "T-shaped designer" who has deep expertise in one area and familiarity with many areas, Jared Spool proposed that modern teams require people with [wider range of functional skills](http://www.ixda.org/node/19573 "Help! Is there a Cardiothorasic Surgeon in the room?").

At the un-conference portion of the event, I facilitated an activity to collect learning resources the participants personally used and found helpful to broaden their skillset. Here's the list for your reference and reading enjoyment!
