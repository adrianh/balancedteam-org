Update 11/24: [Balanced Team Summit 2015 Theme announcement](/?p=1114)

\-\-\-

We're pleased to announce that we will be holding a **Balanced Team Summit on** **June 13 and 14, 2015** in **Grand Rapids, Michigan!** The planning committee is made up of Rick Harlow of Visualhero, Gail Swanson of Manifest Digital, Lane Halley, and Matt Fletcher and myself, Brittany Hunter, from Atomic Object.

The event is a year from now, so we’ve got plenty of time to plan a great conference. Currently, we're working to secure a great venue and choose a theme. We’ve got some great ideas, but everything is under consideration at this point. **Is there a particular theme or question you’ve been wondering about and would like to further explore with fellow Balanced Teamers? [Let us know by filling out our quick google form!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16nZyPM_uN_mUA31GuhH0jDvHaqtQvnRfC4SHD0ev7O0/viewform?usp=send_form)**

We are all super excited to host the conference next year. See you then!
