I've enjoyed reading Steve Blank's [blog](http://steveblank.com/), and think the recent article " [College and Business Will Never Be the Same](http://steveblank.com/2011/02/15/college-and-business-will-never-be-the-same/)" nicely articulates one of the reasons it's so hard to bring different disciplines together to focus on collaborative solutions. Working in silos is baked in from the start.

In most academic programs, design, engineering and business are taught in silos, and the disciplines remain separate as students move into the world of work. Steve makes a proposal for more cross-disciplinary studies and industry engagement during education and mentions Philadelphia Universityâ€™s new degree program, Design, Engineering and Commerce.

[Check it out](http://steveblank.com/2011/02/15/college-and-business-will-never-be-the-same/) and let us know what you think!
