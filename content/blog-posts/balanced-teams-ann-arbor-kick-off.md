#### Balanced Team Ann Arbor is getting started!

On Wednesday, March 30 at 6PM we'll host an evening of open space discussions on Balanced Team topics. Join us to get the conversation about building and working on multi-disciplinary, collaborative teams started.

[Register on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Balanced-Team-Ann-Arbor/events/228960988/)

To facilitate conversation, we’ll follow the Open Space format. The agenda is in your hands, so please bring your ideas or topics of interest. Possible topics could include: your lean success stories, challenges you are having as a member of a product team, transitioning to lean, collaboration within your organization, experimenting and learning from your users/customers, learning from mistakes, combining the different view points of different team members and stakeholders in an optimal way, etc.

Hosted and Sponsored by ITHAKA/JSTOR

Venue, drinks and snacks will be provided courtesy of ITHAKA/JSTOR, located at 301 E. Liberty St -- corner of 5th and Liberty St. on the 3rd floor. If you want to attend, [register on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Balanced-Team-Ann-Arbor/events/228960988/).

#### About Balanced Team

Balanced Team is a global movement of people who value multi-disciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery focused on customer value as a source for innovation. We’re a self-organizing group that learns from each other as we explore processes and methodologies to do good work with happy teams. We welcome people who wear many hats (design, development, testing, product management, marketing and sales, to name a few).

If you’re interested in Lean Startup, Agile, Lean, Agile UX, Lean UX, Devops, Customer Development – or anything else that values multidisciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery – we hope you will join the conversation!
