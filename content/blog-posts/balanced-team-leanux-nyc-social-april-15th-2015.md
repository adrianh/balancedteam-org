### Getting from LeanUX NYC to 36 Cooper Square

A Balanced Team tour guide will lead a group to [36 Cooper Square](https://www.google.com/maps/place/36+Cooper+Sq,+New+York,+NY+10003 "Google Maps for 36 Cooper Square") after the first day of the conference. Just keep an eye peeled and an ear open: we’ll rally somewhere at the conference venue and head over together.

To get there on your own…

- Share a taxi or ride-share service. You can get from Brooklyn to Manhattan via the Williamsburg bridge. That’s 5 miles or 15 minutes without traffic ($15+ by taxi).
- Take the subway. There are several routes that will work, depending on how far you want to walk, so check these [Google Maps directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Brooklyn+Night+Bazaar,+165+Banker+Street,+Brooklyn,+NY+11222/36+Cooper+Square,+New+York,+NY+10003 "Google Maps directions from LeanUX to 36 Cooper Square") or buddy up with a local.
- When you arrive, just look for the Village Voice building, and head to the 6th floor.
