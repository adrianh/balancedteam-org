Happy New Year! We look forward to gathering in Grand Rapids, MI for a weekend of conversation, collaboration and community at the [Balanced Team Summit](/btgr2015 "Balanced Team Summit 2015"). We're going to continue many of the elements that we've enjoyed at past events: a great location, a mix of invited speakers, community contributions, open space sessions and lots of social time. We have an exciting weekend planned, and look forward to your participation.

Our theme this year is " **Balanced Teams Everywhere**"

Balance is action guided by incremental adjustments, rather than an achieved state. At the 2015 Balanced Team Summit, we will explore and share the latest techniques and innovations of Balanced Teams in different sized organizations in the software industry and beyond. Throughout it all, we'll be considering the question, "What does it mean to be a balanced team?"

 [![open-space](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/open-space.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/open-space.jpg)

At its core, Balanced Team is a community and we’re eager to hear from your Balanced Teams. What Balanced Team techniques have worked well for you? What hasn’t worked well? What improvements have you made over the years that are worth sharing? Do you have a nagging question you want help from this group to answer? Are there big issues we need to address in the upcoming year to help build even better Balanced Teams?

Please [let us know what you want to contribute](http://goo.gl/forms/qku7r64Hvn "Balanced Team Summit Session Proposal Form"). If you have more than one idea, it's OK to submit more than once. We're accepting submissions through Friday February 6th, 2015.
