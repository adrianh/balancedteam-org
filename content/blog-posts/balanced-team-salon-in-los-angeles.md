It is time for another Balanced Team meetup for the folks in Los Angeles and SoCal. It is set on Wednesday August 20, 2014 at Fandango in Santa Monica from 6:30pm to 9:30pm.

[RSVP on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/balancedteam/events/199531072/ "RSVP on Meetup")

Instead of sitting down and listening to a few presentations, we have designed an activity for every attendee to participate in discussions and generate ideas together. Come prepared because it will be filled with plenty of conversations from people in the community sharing ideas, socializing, and offering insights from their own experience.

If you’re interested in Lean Startup, Agile, Lean, Agile UX, Lean UX, DevOps, Customer Development—and anything else that values multidisciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery of value—you’ll find this of interest.

To ensure the quality of the activity, this event is capped at 30 attendees. It is free and first come, first serve. Please RSVP at our meetup page and feel free to invite new folks to come along. We know that our diversity always makes the conversation more fun!

Many, many thanks to our wonderful sponsor, Fandango, for providing food, drinks, and materials!
