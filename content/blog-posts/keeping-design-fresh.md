I wanted to share my presentation from the deLUX event a few weeks ago in Boulder. In the time that has past since the event I've update the presentation the help illustrate the term spoilage. It's a term I'm introducing, and it's intended to be provocative. The lost opportunity from design debt is a real tragedy. I'm hopeful that what we talk about in the group can help designers avoid having their efforts wasted working on the wrong priorities.
