[Rick Harlow and I had the pleasure of interviewing](http://www.rapidgrowthmedia.com/features/022615balancedteamsummitgrandrapids.aspx) with West Michigan-based magazine [RapidGrowth](http://www.rapidgrowthmedia.com/) about the upcoming Balanced Team Summit. Here's a nice little excerpt :

> “To me, if I had to explain the value proposition,” says Harlow, “it would be: Everything from startups to large companies, everyone from experienced people to people just trying to learn about it. And hopefully it becomes, similar to that story map: We’ve structured an event to allow for a purposeful conversation around, what does it mean to work among a diverse group of people with different skills and talents to accomplish things?”

Please [check it out here](http://www.rapidgrowthmedia.com/features/022615balancedteamsummitgrandrapids.aspx), rebroadcast to your social circles, and then [purchase a ticket for the event](/btgr2015/)! Enjoy!
