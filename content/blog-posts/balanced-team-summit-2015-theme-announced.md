Hello friends! We are pleased to announce the theme for the **Balanced Team Summit on** **June 13 and 14, 2015** in **Grand Rapids, Michigan!** Balanced Teams EverywhereBalance is action guided by incremental adjustments, rather than an achieved state. At the 2015 Balanced Team Summit, we will explore and share the latest techniques and innovations of Balanced Teams in different sized organizations in the software industry and beyond. Throughout it all, we'll be considering the question, "What does it mean to be a balanced team?"

We're working on launching our conference website and will make a call for submissions soon.
