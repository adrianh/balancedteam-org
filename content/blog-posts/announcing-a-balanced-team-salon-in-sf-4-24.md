## Balanced Team Salon SF

We're pleased to announce a Balanced Team Salon April 24, 2014 at Carbon Five in San Francisco CA.

 **[RSVP on EVENTBRITE](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/balanced-team-salon-sf-tickets-11323925165)**

Salons are becoming popular format in the BT community as they involve plenty of networking, short talks from people in the community sharing what they've learned and then a fishbowl - a collaborative, inclusive conversation that allows many people to get involved and share.

With quite a few people in our SF community coming back from an amazing day-long BT NYC Salon we thought we might bring some of that energy and discussion back home. Our talks will share some of the learning and intrigues from the Salon and Lean UX 2014 conference. And then we'll pull out some of the more intriguing themes and topics that were discussed as starters for our fishbowl.

Please feel free to invite new folks to come along. We know that our diversity always makes the conversation more fun!
