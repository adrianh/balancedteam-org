Balanced Team Los Angeles is back and will be hosting an evening of conversation and consumption on May 20th, 2015 from 6:30PM to 9PM at [Rhubarb Studios](http://www.rhubarbstudios.co) in Downtown Los Angeles.

If you’re interested in Lean Startup, Agile, Lean, Agile UX, Lean UX, DevOps, Customer Development—and anything else that values multidisciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery of value—you’ll find this of interest.

To facilitate conversation, we’ll follow the [Lean Coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) format. The agenda is in your hands, so please bring your ideas or topics of interest. Balanced Team experts will be on-hand for those interested in learning more.

A HUGE thank you to [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotal.io/labs) for providing the food and drink!

For early arrivers (6:30-7:00), there will be a drone flying demo and a chance to ride a [Onewheel](http://rideonewheel.com/).
