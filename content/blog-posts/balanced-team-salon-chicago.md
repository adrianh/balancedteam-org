Balanced Team is hosting a spring Salon in Chicago on May 2nd, 2015 from 10am–3pm. It will be an open un-conference format focusing on sharing our experiences and good conversation. Those new to Balanced Team are encouraged to attend. Also, it will be a time to get the conversation started ahead of the Balanced Team Summit in Grand Rapids.

Those attending will help set the topics for the day in the collaborative spaces of Pivotal Labs’ Chicago office, inside the Merchandise Mart. We will have Balanced Team experts coming in from all corners to share their experiences.

Space is limited to best encourage good conversation, so [RSVP today](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/balanced-team-salon-chicago-tickets-16435751776). Pivotal Labs will be sponsoring food and drink throughout the Salon.
