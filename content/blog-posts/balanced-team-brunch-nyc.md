April 14 2013, a group of Balanced Team members met at the offices of [Neo](http://www.neo.com/), NYC for a social gathering and mini-unconference on topics of interest: Agile+UX+Lean Startup. We enjoyed bagels and coffee and collected topics of interest which we then discussed in [fishbowl conversation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_%28conversation%29 "Fishbowl Conversation ") format. Below, please find a photo and a list of topics provided by the group.
