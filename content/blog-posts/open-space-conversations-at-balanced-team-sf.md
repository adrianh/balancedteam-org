title: Open Space Conversations at Balanced Team SF
url: /2013/12/23/btsf2013-open-space/

---
At the [Balanced Team meeting in San Francisco](/2013/09/03/balanced-team-sf-2013-tickets-and-call-for-submissions/ "Balanced Team SF 2013 microsite"), our program consisted mostly of [prepared presentations](http://lanyrd.com/2013/balancedteam/slides/ "Slides from Balanced Team SF 2013"). Because dialog and participation are so important to us, we reserved some time Sunday afternoon to solicit conversation topics from the participants.

Over lunch, the group was asked to think about one or more "conversation topics you'd like to lead." We collected these topics on sticky notes and put them on the wall. Each speaker briefly introduced the topic they wrote and then the group placed a pen mark on up to three of the topics they would like to participate in. (also called "dot voting"). The topics with the most dots were assigned rooms. People assembled in the rooms that interested them. The conversation hosts were encouraged to share back the outcome of their conversation with the group afterwards through a blog post and/or coverage on the event.

If you want to learn more about Open Space Technology, I encourage you to read this [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology "Open Space Technology on Wikipedia").

## Selected topics

These were the topics the group selected for conversation

- Experiment Mapping workshop
- Lean is for Discovery, Agile is for Delivery
- Experience Wheel workshop
- Let's Create a framework for metrics driven design
- Why is the Balanced Team conference not balanced? Does the split indicate that balanced team is a design insurgency? 60% design,20% dev, 20% pm. What about researchers and social scientists? There are only a handful here and yet they bring tremendous value to a "balanced team." How do we really know? Can people share why they were drawn here this weekend? Maybe they don't fit neatly into those categories\
- Workload prioritization / management tools
